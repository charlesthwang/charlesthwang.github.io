			<p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">I recently donated blood for the first time, but had a difficult time trying to schedule an appointment through the Red Cross Blood Donor app.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">It was frustrating that the app continually displayed appointment dates that didn't have any open time slots, but the process flow also felt inefficient.
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">My challenge was to simplify the scheduling flow, while also updating the UI to feel more like <a class="font-extrabold border-b border-red-700 hover:border-transparent hover:text-red-700 focus:text-red-700 focus:border-b-0 transition duration-200 ease-in-out" href="https://material.io/components" target="_blank">Material Design</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="font-serif font-black text-3xl">Validating the Problem</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">I wanted to know if I was the only one who struggled to make an appointment on the app, so I dove in to the app reviews on both the App Store and the Play Store.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">The app seemed to have other technical issues, but there were many people who also expressed frustration scheduling an appointment. <span class="font-extrabold">Many deserted the app altogether to schedule an appointment over the phone or on the website.</span></p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 font-bold text-xl">Location and Search Results</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">This was the most frustrating stage of the scheduling flow. The app doesn't let the user choose a specific donation center and just lists all centers <span class="font-extrabold italic">near</span> them. And so, because the search results combines <span class="font-extrabold italic">both</span> the date and location, the resulting list is unwieldy.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">Imagine trying to select an appointment from a search that covered a 14-day span for <span class="font-extrabold italic">every</span> location in your area. ðŸ¤¯ This is exacerbated by the fact that the app shows dates and locations that doesn't have any open time slots.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">It's also difficult to parse the information. There's a lot of repetitive text and the dateâ€”arguably the most important parameterâ€”is in a smaller font size.</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold text-xl">New Task Flow</h3>
			<p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">I based my design around the assumption that users most value being able to search open time slots at a donation center <span class="font-extrabold">of their choosing</span>. This generates search results that are much more managable and easier to act on.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 font-bold text-xl">Choosing a Location</h3>

			<p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">Users can also set a donation center as their "home location", allowing them to search times at their most preferred center by default.</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold text-xl">Creating your Appointment</h3>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">After selecting a date and donation center, users can choose from open times to create an appointment (if a date range was entered, users are first presented with dates that have availability).</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">The biggest change I made here was to combine selecting the time and donation type into one task. Users can see all open times <span class="font-extrabold italic">and</span> the donation types available at those times.</p>
			<p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">This eliminates the step of users currently having to choose a time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) and solves their need to search for more than donation type at a time.</p>

			<h2 class="font-serif font-black text-3xl">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">I learned a lot working through this project. Although I was unable to perform usuability testing (due to social distancing measures), I was able to distill the information gathered from app reviews into a clear user archetype that helped keep my process centered around user needs. This project was also a great exercise in taking complicated user flows and and interactions and finding ways to simplify and streamline them.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">Although my design choices were based on user feedback, they still involved some trade-offs. My search results are limited to one location at a time, which could be too restricting for some users. There's always room for improvement, but hopefully this concept could help people find more opportunities to donate.</p>
